Amazon books rating dataset. Col. 1 is reviewer ID, col. 2 is product ID, col. 3
is rating, col. 4 is unix time stamp (can ignore).

dataprep.dml converts the data into matrix form. Run with sparkDML.sh -f
.../dataprep.dml --args input.csv output.scv

It can be helpful to generate subsets of the data. To do so, first shuffle the
original ratings data with shuf to randomly permute the lines. Then take the
first N lines with head -n N, and finally run dataprep.dml it to get the matrix.
