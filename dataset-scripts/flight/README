Flight delay dataset. 2007.csv contains the data for 2007, and 2008.csv for
2008. To get the data into matrix form, first concatenate the two files. Be
careful to remove the first line (the header). Then remove any non numeric
columns, or recode them into numbers. SystemML DML can do this, or use python
pandas. To get a denser matrix, the last 7/8 columns may be removed (they are
mostly 0).
