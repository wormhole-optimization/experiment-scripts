Netflix movie ratings data. complete.txt contains the combined raw data, in the form: 

movie-id:
user-id,rating,date
user-id,rating,date
user-id,rating,date
user-id,rating,date
...

number contains rust code to prefix the movie-id to each line to make the data
relational. Remember to run with the release flag, i.e. cargo run --release ...
Next, use dataprep.dml to convert the table into a matrix. Again, one may take
subsets of the data by shuffling the table with shuf (important!) and taking the
head.

matrix.csv contains the entire data in matrix form, and net50k.csv samples 50k
ratings.
